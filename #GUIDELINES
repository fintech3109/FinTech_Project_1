# Project Proposal and Outline
    Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. 
    This will help provide direction and safeguard against scope creep. Your should format the proposal 
    and outline as a brief summary of your interests and intent. Make sure to include:
    
    * The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (e.g., trading, quantitative analysis)
    * The questions you’ll ask of the data
    * Possible source for the data
